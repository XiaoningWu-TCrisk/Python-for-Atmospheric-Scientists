### Here I use Jupyter Notebooks to show the codes and results for better readability. You don't have to rely on Jupyter Notebooks to use Python. You can use other [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and many others. You can also decide not to use any of them.
