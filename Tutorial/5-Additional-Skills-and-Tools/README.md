# 1. New Python packages to learn
I get to know new Python packages while doing research or reading Python related materials for fun. If something looks useful to our research, I would like to add it to this list and have a try later. [GitHub](https://github.com/), [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/) are three example sources of these information. I am also looking forward to learning from you. Suggestions are welcome!

# 2. Version control with Git 

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a commonly used tool for version control. In plain language, with Git, you will be able to know **"who"** did **"what changes"** to **"which file"** at **"what time"**. And you can always **trace back any previous versions and revert any changes**. It helps you to develop your codes and collaborate with others. You can search online to know more benefits of using Git.

Version control with Git is not just for Python, it is heavily used in any software engineering acativities and is useful in atmospheric research as well. You can use Git while developing codes for a research project. And if you are a modeller, you can use Git to switch model versions and keep track of any changes you applied to your model source codes, configuration files, job submission scripts etc.

There are different ways to use Git, including GitHub on a browswer, GitHub desktop APP and Git GUI. Many training materials are freely available online. You can have a try with [this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) to learn how to use GitHub, or [this](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) to learn about GitHub desktop, or [Eloise's tutorial](https://maraisresearchgroup.co.uk/Presentations/GitCommands4GEOS-Chem.pdf) to try Git GUI. There are also many video tutorials freely available on YouTube.

# 3. Python tools for practical challenges
Sometimes researchers have to deal with some practical challenges. 

For example, you have to merge personal information from multiple PDF files when making an application for something. What would you do if you don't want to pay for an Adobe account or any other commercial software? Do you trust those free online PDF handlers? 

In another case, you want to add a GIF file in your research talk to show multi-years of some research data. But again you don't want to pay for any software, then do you trust those free online GIF generators?

Things like these motivated me to find or build Python tools to solve practical challenges independently and safely. Jupyter notebooks for these are shown above. You can write your own tools as well!
