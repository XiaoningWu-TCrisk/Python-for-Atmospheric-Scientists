## Python Tutorial for Atmospheric Scientists

**This tutorial focuses on how to use Python to conduct research in atmospheric sciences. Some general Python knowledge and packages used in research are introduced with examples from research in atmospheric sciences.** For absolute beginners who are not familiar with some Python basics like "what is Python", "how to launch Python" and "how to install Python packages", please see my suggestions [below](https://github.com/GongdaLu/Python-Tutorial-for-Atmospheric-Scientists#suggestions-for-absolute-beginners).

## Suggestions for absolute beginners
Python is widely used in our field, it has a few [advantanges](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#why-python) over other programming languages. 

You can go through some short Software Carpentry tutorials to have a try with Python, for example, [this](https://bham-carpentries.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) or [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html). Once you have managed some Python basics, I recommend chapters 2-4 in [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). For those who want to quickly get started with handling NetCDF files, I strongly recommend this excellent [Python/xarray tutorial for GEOS-Chem users](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial). You can also find free video tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Python) or other platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/) etc.

No matter which introductory tutorials you choose, I would suggest you to ignore anything irrelevant if you just need Python to do your research. Otherwise you will probably find Python hard to learn. When I was a beginner, I once read tutorials which started with things like how to roll a dice using Python. Those kinds of tutorials discouraged me a lot, because I could not do anything with my research after spending so much time learning Python. You can also have a look at [opinions](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python) from research computing experts in our field. 

Apart from going through tutorials, learning while doing research is an important way of learning Python. Whenever you meet any problems in research computing, just search your questions or error messages online, you will probably find existing solutions, especially on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Once you have found solutions to a problem, then others' codes and knowledge become yours forever. And these can be always reused in your research career. I would encourage you to practice asking questions online. As you become experienced, you will know how to ask a question to find potential solutions faster. 

## Acknowledgements
I am thankful for the introductory Python tutorials provided by Software Carpentry and the Advanced Research Computing team at University of Birmingham. I also thank Dr. Eloise Marais and Dr. John Roberts for their valuable coaching. In the end, I would like to thank the Stack Overflow community, authors of many Python packages, Python bloggers, and many others sharing the knowledge of Python.
